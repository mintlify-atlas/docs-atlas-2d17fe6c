Start the xmcp development server with hot module reloading.

## Usage

```bash
xmcp dev [options]
```

## Options

<ParamField path="--cf" type="boolean">
  Enable Cloudflare Workers output in development mode. When set, the compiler will prepare artifacts compatible with Cloudflare Workers runtime.
  
  This option can also be triggered by setting the `CF_PAGES` environment variable to `"1"`.
</ParamField>

## Examples

Start development server:

```bash
xmcp dev
```

Start development server with Cloudflare Workers support:

```bash
xmcp dev --cf
```

Using environment variable:

```bash
CF_PAGES=1 xmcp dev
```

## How it works

The dev command:

1. Initializes the compiler context in development mode
2. Watches for file changes in your source directory
3. Automatically recompiles when files are modified
4. Enables platform-specific features when flags are set

<Info>
  Development mode enables fast refresh and detailed error reporting to help you iterate quickly.
