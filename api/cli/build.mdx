Compile your xmcp server for production deployment with platform-specific optimizations.

## Usage

```bash
xmcp build [options]
```

## Options

<ParamField path="--vercel" type="boolean">
  Build for Vercel deployment. Generates the `.vercel/output` directory structure required by Vercel's Build Output API.
  
  This option can also be triggered by setting the `VERCEL` environment variable to `"1"`.
  
  <Note>This flag is ignored when using the experimental adapter configuration.</Note>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--cf" type="boolean">
  Build for Cloudflare Workers deployment. Prepares artifacts optimized for Cloudflare Workers runtime.
  
  This option can also be triggered by setting the `CF_PAGES` environment variable to `"1"`.
</ParamField>

## Examples

Standard production build:

```bash
xmcp build
```

Build for Vercel:

```bash
xmcp build --vercel
```

Build for Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
xmcp build --cf
```

Build for both platforms:

```bash
xmcp build --vercel --cf
```

Using environment variables:

```bash
VERCEL=1 xmcp build
```

## How it works

The build command:

1. Initializes the compiler context in production mode
2. Compiles all source files with optimizations
3. Generates platform-specific output when flags are set
4. Creates deployment-ready artifacts

### Vercel output

When building with `--vercel`, the command generates:

- `.vercel/output/config.json` - Vercel configuration
- `.vercel/output/functions/` - Serverless functions
- `.vercel/output/static/` - Static assets

### Cloudflare output

When building with `--cf`, the command generates:

- Cloudflare Workers compatible bundle
- Optimized for edge runtime execution

<Tip>
  Platform flags can be combined in a single build command to prepare for multiple deployment targets.
