description: Deploy your xmcp server to production environments
---

xmcp provides multiple deployment options to suit your infrastructure needs. The framework includes built-in build commands and platform-specific optimizations for seamless deployment.

## Deployment Options

xmcp supports three primary deployment strategies:

  <Card title="Vercel" icon="triangle" href="/deployment/vercel">
    Zero-config deployment to Vercel's serverless platform
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cloudflare Workers" icon="cloudflare" href="/deployment/cloudflare-workers">
    Edge deployment with Cloudflare Workers
  </Card>
  <Card title="Self-Hosting" icon="server" href="/deployment/self-hosting">
    Deploy to your own infrastructure with Docker or Node.js
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Build Command

The `xmcp build` command compiles your server for production:

```bash
xmcp build
```

This command:
- Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
- Bundles all dependencies
- Generates optimized output in `dist/`
- Creates both HTTP (`dist/http.js`) and stdio (`dist/stdio.js`) entry points

### Output Structure

After running `xmcp build`, you'll find:

```
dist/
├── http.js       # HTTP transport server
├── stdio.js      # stdio transport server
├── index.js      # Main server logic
└── ...           # Additional bundled modules
```

## Platform-Specific Builds

xmcp provides platform-specific build flags for optimized deployment:

### Vercel

```bash
xmcp build --vercel
```

Creates a `.vercel/output` directory with Vercel's Build Output API structure.

<Info>
  The `--vercel` flag is automatically detected when `VERCEL=1` environment variable is set.
</Info>

### Cloudflare Workers

```bash
xmcp build --cf
```

Generates a `worker.js` file bundled for Cloudflare Workers runtime.

<Info>
  The `--cf` flag is automatically detected when `CF_PAGES=1` environment variable is set.
</Info>

## Environment Detection

xmcp automatically detects the deployment platform using environment variables:

| Platform | Environment Variable | Auto-detected |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| Vercel | `VERCEL=1` | Yes |
| Cloudflare | `CF_PAGES=1` | Yes |
| Self-hosted | None | Default |

This means you don't need to specify build flags in your CI/CD pipelines—xmcp will automatically use the correct build configuration.

## Running in Production

After building, run your server:

### HTTP Transport

```bash
node dist/http.js
```

### stdio Transport

```bash
node dist/stdio.js
```

### Custom Port

Set the `PORT` environment variable (defaults to `3001`):

```bash
PORT=8080 node dist/http.js
```
