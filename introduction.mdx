## The TypeScript MCP Framework

xmcp is a framework for building and shipping MCP servers with TypeScript. Designed with DX in mind, it streamlines development and lowers the barrier to entry for anyone looking to create and deploy powerful tools on top of the Model Context Protocol ecosystem.

## Key Features

### File System Routing

Tools and prompts are auto-registered from a `tools` and `prompts` directory. Simply create a file, export your tool or prompt, and xmcp handles the rest.

```typescript
// src/tools/greet.ts
import { z } from "zod";
import { type InferSchema, type ToolMetadata } from "xmcp";

export const schema = {
  name: z.string().describe("The name of the user to greet"),
};

export const metadata: ToolMetadata = {
  name: "greet",
  description: "Greet the user",
};

export default function greet({ name }: InferSchema<typeof schema>) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

### Hot Reloading

Get instant development feedback with hot reloading. Changes to your tools and prompts are reflected immediately without restarting the server.

### Middlewares

Toolkit for shipping authentication and custom middlewares. Add API key authentication, logging, rate limiting, and more with a simple middleware system.

### Extensible Configuration

Customizable configuration for your MCP server through `xmcp.config.ts`. Configure your server name, version, transport options, and more.

### Deploy Anywhere

Flexible deployment across any platform. Deploy to Vercel, Express, Next.js, NestJS, or any Node.js environment.

### Vercel Support

Zero-configuration deployment with Vercel. Built-in adapter makes it easy to deploy your MCP server to Vercel with no additional setup.
